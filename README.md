## Prerequisites

This chapter servers as a quick refresher to bring you up to speed on some of the concept Infinidash is built on. We won't spend too much time on these points as it is assumed that are already familiar with most of them.

### Reactive encryption

_wip_

### Synchronizing hexadecimal transpilers

_wip_

## Infinidash Foundations

In this chapter, we will go over the main differences between Infinidash and the existing solutions for data transmission using reactive encryption and hexadecimal transpilation (DTuREaHT for short).

### Pre-journaled cache coherent schedulers

_wip_

### Authentication using unicasted cache binds

_wip_

### Radix-queue-hardened certificates

_wip_

## Advanced concepts

This chapter covers some of the more advanced topics you might encounter during the exam. Note that while these concepts are useful to know, you won’t really use most of them in your day-to-day work. The notable exceptions to this rule are the sections about _Delta-sharding nodes_ and _Security policy configuration using recursive gradient decent_.

### Vertical network scaling and transformative process descriptors

_wip_

### Delta-sharding nodes

_wip_

### Security configuration using resursive gradient descent

_wip_

## Security considerations

While Infinidash takes care of the most common attacks, such as _Autoscaler slicing_ and _Proximity explosives_, there are still some security considerations to keep in mind when setting up your Infinidash cluster manager.

### Forescent layer-2 attacks

_wip_

### Reintermediate hashtag spoofing
